# FRC Scouting Application Template

An AngularJS and Semantic UI template for FRC scouting applications.

FRC Team 955 holds pride in its scouting applications, which, for the past three years (2013 through 2015 competitions) have been built by hand; first in Java, and now in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. With this project, we hope to create a template for future applications. There are a few things that we need to aim for: 

+	Functionality
	+	Using AngularJS gives us a wide variety of capabilities. Tie in some JQuery, and we have all the manipulation we need: Back-end and front-end included.
+	Style
	+	Using the stylish CSS framework Semantic Ui gives us a great variety of styled elements to chose from, plus just a dash of hipster cred (Semantic UI?).
+	Standardization
	+	Instead of having to build an entire application every year, having a template will allow our team to do less work. Plus, if you want it, take this template and build your own application! I recommend it for teaching students real-world skills. I won't be offended if you don't use our app.
